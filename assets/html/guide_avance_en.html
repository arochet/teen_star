<h3>1- Scientific basis</h3>
The self-observation proposed here is linked to the secretion of mucus (also called "cervical mucus")
produced by the uterine cervix, and which flows to the vulva. Its properties were discovered in 1953 and
scientifically studied by 2 doctors (Professor Erik Odeblad, specialist in medical bio-physics at Umea
University, Sweden; Professor James B. Brown, professor of endocrinology, New Zealand).
<b>It is not recommended to look for this mucus inside the vagina, as this would, among other
things, distort observation or sensation.</b>

<h3>3- Cycles tab (summary table, cycle summary)</h3>
The colours in the 3rd column (after the date), automatic according to the chosen combination of vulvar
sensation + mucus observation, are applied <b>by default pending your manual interpretation of the cycle</b>
(see § 4):
 by default in <b>BLUE</b> (water colour) = any presence of moisture (in SENSATION or
OBSERVATION)

 by default in <b>YELLOW</b> (sand colour) = Dry + non-estrogenic mucus (opaque, non-
stretchable

 by default in <b>BROWN</b> (earth colour) = Dry + no visible mucus
 by default <b>COLOURLESS</b> = other situations
 <b>with a "?"</b> = "Other" sensation or observation.
 <b>DARK RED</b> = clear bleeding (menstruation or other)
 <b>RED</b> = less abundant bleeding (beginning/end of menstruation; other)
 <b>RED PALE</b> = traces of blood, red or brown
N.B. any presence of blood automatically gives priority to RED.


<h3>4- Cycle analysis function</h3>

The ANALYSIS column, a duplicate of the automatic COLOUR column, allows manual interpretation of the
cycle by clicking on one or more boxes to be modified. Optional, left to the discretion of the tutor or for

advanced users.
• <b>flower</b> : peak of cycle, maximum fertility, imminent ovulation (recognized a posteriori on the
day the of the fertile mucus rise)
• <b>1, 2, 3</b>: days after peak (or after an episode of change in the BIP).
• <b>hatched</b> : infertile periods (pre-ovulatory BIP; luteal phase infertile period)
• <b>BLUE</b> : sensation and observation typical of an estrogenic surge, with or without a
peak
• <b>YELLOW</b> : Dry + non-elastic opaque or other situation suggestive of a secretory
infertile profile (see "special cases")
• <b>BROWN</b> : Dry + no mucus or other situation suggestive of a non-secretory infertile
profile.
<b>SPECIAL CASES:</b>
Many of the boxes are colourless, as the user is never able to recognize the sensations ("Unperceived"
sensation).
If she can easily identify herself thanks to very characteristic and clear secretion profiles, she could
colour the boxes according to the mucus alone, ignoring the sensation (while continuing to practise
feeling it): BLUE for estrogenic mucus surges (stretchy to stringy), YELLOW for non-estrogenic mucus
(opaque not stretchy) and BROWN for no mucus.
Box with a "?" because the user has recorded "Other" (sensation or observation). A discussion* with the
tutor will clarify the nature of this "other" situation and colour the box accordingly.
*N.B. the same applies to "Dried deposit", to distinguish vaginal secretions from mucus secretions of
one type or another.
Pre-ovulatory BIP and hatching: advanced self-observation users can identify their BIP.

Reminder: <b>BIP = Basic Infertile Pattern</b> = sequence that does not change day after day in the pre-
ovulatory period (sensation and visual appearance remain the same, indicating cervical inactivity).

It can be of the following types:
- Non-secretory BIP: <b>dry + no mucus</b> (brown boxes, to be hatched )
- Secretory BIP: <b>dry + opaque mucus</b> (yellow boxes, to be hatched) or sensation of moisture +

opaque mucus (blue boxes by default due to humidity,
which can be coloured in yellow and hatched ).
- N.B. Case of <b>dry BIP dry + dried</b> deposit (colourless cells):
a) The dried deposit is clearly identified as:
• dried mucus: colourless boxes to be coloured in yellowed and hatched
• dried vaginal discharge (without cervical mucus): colourless boxes to be coloured in
brown and hatched

b) The deposit is not clearly identified: leave colourless and hatched:

<h3>5- History tab</h3>

Summarises the ANALYSIS columns for each cycle. Click on the cycle number to access its Summary
table and (re)analyse it if required.
The Return to previous cycle button can be used to cancel the creation of a new cycle by mistake, e.g.
when bleeding was mistaken for menstruation.
