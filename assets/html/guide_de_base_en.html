<h2>FOUNDING PRINCIPLES</h2>

<b>"My body is me, I listen to what it tells me"</b>. To know it better is to discover the marvel that I
am!<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">Aims</h3>
To facilitate your daily recordings, so that you can learn self-observation and discover your fertility and
your cycles (progressive development of the cycle from puberty onwards, personal profile of fertility
signs, ovulation period, predictable date of next period, variations in mood and physical condition
linked to hormonal changes, impact of certain events on the progress of the cycle, possible
abnormalities, etc.).

<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">How to observe myself:</h3>

<u>What I feel at the vulva without looking </u>(<b>SENSATION</b>): during my daily activities (walking, stairs, ...) or
by contracting/releasing the perineum several times (Kegel exercise).
<u>What I see </u>(<b>OBSERVATION</b>): what flows from the vulva, on underwear, in the loo, on loo paper (which
I can fold/unfold to assess the elasticity of any secretion). <b>Do not look for anything inside the
vagina.</b><br>
Caution: in the event of abnormal discharge (dirty or foul-smelling) and/or pain, itching, small sores
near the vulva, etc., consult a doctor so as not to overlook an infection (sexually transmitted or other)
which needs to be treated very quickly.

<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">How to record it:</h3>

<span style="color: rgb(33, 150, 243)">Daily observations:</span> record <b>the most fertile sign of the day</b> IN THE EVENING (SENSATION and
OBSERVATION).<br><br>
Select <span style="color: rgb(33, 150, 243)">Start new cycle</span> on 1st day of menstruation, otherwise continue current cycle.<br>
Among the possible notes, #1 and #2 are two types of events of your choice, always the same, and →
corresponds to travel or unusual schedules (jet lag or late bedtime the night before, night shift,
interrupted night,...). You can also record your basal body temperature (taken at the same time every
day, before getting up) to observe its rise in the 2nd part of the cycle.
</h3 style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">Cycle overview:</h3>
The <span style="color: rgb(33, 150, 243)">Cycles</span> tab summarises the cycle in a table, adding colours by default, but which <b>do NOT
correspond to fertile or infertile periods of the cycle.</b><br><br>
Clicking on a line allows you to reread a note or, with the help of your tutor, to manually interpret the
cycle (see next page: <span style="color: rgb(33, 150, 243)">Advanced Guide</span> § 4).
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">Retention of recordings:</h3>
The data will only appear on your device (<b>lost cell phone = lost data</b>).<br>
Tip: <span style="color: rgb(33, 150, 243)">Export your cycles as PDF files</span> ( <img src="asset:assets/icon_app/icon_pdf.png" width="40"></img>) on a regular basis, for archiving on a computer
(useful later or in case of medical consultation), printing on paper or sending to your companion<br><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 69, 130)">CONDITIONS OF USE</span>: I have read the above points and understand that <b>this application</b> will help
me record my daily observations during my menstrual cycles, but <b>is in no way sufficient on its own
to prevent </b>(or promote) <b>pregnancy</b>. I understand that if this were my goal, I would need to undergo
<b>in-depth training with an instructor</b> specialising in natural birth control methods.<br><br>
